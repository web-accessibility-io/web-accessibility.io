# Web Accessibility Guidelines Summary

This project will help you get up to speed with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), and avoid common accessibility mistakes. This summary is a simplification. If you're not sure how a guideline applies, check the official guidelines [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

It only covers Level A and Level AA requirements, which are referenced in [public sector procurement laws in the UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps), [US public sector procurement laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_508_Amendment_to_the_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973), [EU public sector procurement laws](http://mandate376.standards.eu/standard/technical-requirements/#9) and [public sector procurement laws around the world](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/).
