# Error prevention (legal, financial, data)

## Summary

**If users are making a legal commitment, a financial transaction or updating personal data, give them a way to review and check that the information they've entered before submitting it.**

When completion of a form causes a legal commitment, triggers a financial transaction, or gives consent for personal data to be updated, the user must be able to review, correct, and confirm that the information they have entered is correct, or they must be able to reverse the decision.

---

## Requirements

*   When data is submitted leading to a legal commitment, financial transaction, or an update to personal data, a review page is presented that allows the user to review, correct, and confirm the information they have entered.

### Common mistakes

*   An online shop where order details are not displayed again for confirmation just before users' commit the transaction.

### Why?

This provides safeguards to prevent people with disabilities, and indeed all users, from making avoidable mistakes.
