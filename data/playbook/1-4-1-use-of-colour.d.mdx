# Use of colour

## Summary

**Do not use colour as the only way to convey any piece of information.**

Colour alone should not used to convey information (e.g. to identify form fields with invalid entries or the current step in a step indicator) or to distinguish between areas of a map or graph.

---

## Requirements

* Colour alone is not used to convey information (e.g. to identify form fields with invalid entries or the current step in a step indicator) or to distinguish between areas of a map or graph. Additional visual cues are used to provide the same information (e.g. icons, shapes, patterns, text).
  * Text identified by colour as having special meaning has another indicator - a visible border and label, underline or other visual effect.
  * Information graphics and charts that use colour as a key also provide distinctive non-colour differences - hatching patterns or directly applied labels.

* All links within blocks of text are underlined, and no other content on the page is underlined.
  * If links cannot be underlined and are identified via colour alone, the contrast ratio between their colour and the colour of the surrounding text is at least 3:1, and their visual appearance changes (e.g. they become underlined) when they are hovered by the mouse pointer and receive [keyboard focus](/playbook/definitions#keyboard-focus).

### Why?

* This ensures that people who are unable to see colours, or who have difficulty telling different colours apart, understand the content and user interface.
* Colours can be difficult to distinguish in bright sunlight.
* Screen readers do not detect colour.
* Some users will change colour settings for their whole computer, such as applying a tint to help with reading.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.4.1 Use of Color:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html) Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Design

Colour is often used to show:
* a tab is selected,
* a link is available,
* text is an error message,
* emphasis,
* charts and graphics, or
* other meaningful information.

Additional visual and non-visual methods of identifying information or meaning must be applied to complement the use of colour:
* Visual cues could be:
  * text complementing colours;
  * text styles (such as underline, bold or italic);
  * patterns (in graphs or infographics, for example);
  * icons with suitable alternative text;
  * border-with changes (to identify that a text input field is in focus, for example);
  * ...
* Non-visual cues, which are programmatically available to assistive technologies, could be:
  * visually hidden text;
  * HTML element tags (such as `aria-disabled` for the Web);
  * suitable ['Accessible Names'](/playbook/definitions#accessible-name) for elements;
  * ...

### Common mistakes

* A form uses only colour to indicate a required field.
* Colour-coding text or backgrounds to indicate essential content, pass/fail categorisation, etc.
* Links are only distinguished from plain text by colour and the colour may not vary from the main body text.
* Text alternatives that do not include information conveyed by colour differences in the original image.
* The error state of a input field is only identified by changing the colour of its border.

### How to style links

* It's best for all links within blocks of text to be underlined, and no other content on the page to be underlined.
* If links cannot be underlined and are identified via colour alone, the contrast ratio between their colour and the colour of the surrounding text is at least 3:1, and their visual appearance changes (e.g. they become underlined) when they receive the mouse hover and keyboard focus.
  * Note that this method doesn't help users using touch screen devices
* Links in a navigation menu do not need underlining, as their presence of a navigation menu makes it obvious that they're links.
