## Summary

Headings must indicate the topic or purpose of the content in that section of the page, and labels must indicate the purpose of the field they relate to.

---

## Requirements

*   Make sure that elements that are identified as headings in code describe the purpose or topic of the content that follows;
*   Make sure that elements that are identified as labels in code indicate the purpose of the input fields/components that they relate to.

### Common mistakes

*   A heading does not indicate the purpose or topic of the content that follows;
*   A label does not indicate the purpose of the field or input component it relates to.

### Why?

This ensures that:
* People can understand the purpose of the content and form controls on the page.
* Screen reader users can easily navigate to relevant sections of content on the page, and understand the purpose of each form input.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**2.4.6 Headings and Labels:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-descriptive.html) Headings and labels describe topic or purpose. (Level AA)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-descriptive.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Design

### Headings

* When you write headings for sections of a page/screen, make sure that the heading describes the topic or purpose of the section of content that it introduces
* On your designs, indicate which elements should be coded as headings. This ensures that:
  * ... developers correctly identify headings in code
  * ... large text that shouldn't be a heading doesn't get coded as such

### Labels

* The labels that you write for text input fields or any other form controls (like radio buttons) need to clearly describe the purpose of the element they relate to
