# Timing adjustable

## Summary

**If there is any time limit (like a session timeout), give people an easy way to extend it.**

When a time limit is set (like a session timeout), it must be possible for the user to turn it off, delay it, or extend the length of time.

---

## Requirements

* If it is necessary to implement timeouts (e.g. for security reasons), users should be informed when a timeout is about to occur and be given the option to extend it.

### Common mistakes

*   A time limit is set, but a user is unable to turn it off, delay it, or extend it;
*   A time limit warning is displayed, but a userâ€™s attention is not drawn to it in an appropriate way.

### Why?

This ensures that people who need longer to complete tasks because of cognitive or mobility impairments, are able to do so comfortably.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**2.2.1 Timing Adjustable:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-required-behaviors.html) For each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the following is true: (Level A)
>
> * **Turn off**: The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or
> * **Adjust**: The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or
> * **Extend**: The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, "press the space bar"), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or
> * **Real-time Exception**: The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or
> * **Essential Exception**: The time limit is essential and extending it would invalidate the activity; or
> * **20 Hour Exception**: The time limit is longer than 20 hours.
>
> Note: This success criterion helps ensure that users can complete tasks without unexpected changes in content or context that are a result of a time limit. This success criterion should be considered in conjunction with Success Criterion 3.2.1, which puts limits on changes of content or context as a result of user action.

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-required-behaviors.html) with techniques and examples.
