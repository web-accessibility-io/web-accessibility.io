# Information and relationships

## Summary

**Make sure that information and relationships that are conveyed visually (like distinct sections within a page, or a label next to a checkbox) are also identified in code.**

When content structures like tables, lists, sections and headings are communicated visually, they should also be coded in ways that assistive technologies can understand.

---

## Requirements

- Headings are presented using the correct elements or properties in code;
- Form fields have properly associated labels;
- Form fields with format requirements or other additional information have properly associated hints.
- Tabular data is presented using the correct markup;
- Lists of items are presented using the correct markup;
- Sets of radio buttons or checkboxes have a `<fieldset>` element to group them together, and a `<legend>` element to provide a label for the group.

### Why?

This ensures that the structure of the content that's conveyed visually by the designs is also available to screen reader, screen magnifier and speech recognition tool users.

Here's a [fun video illustrating the difference this makes for screen reader users](https://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/mobile/structure/headings).

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.3.1 Info and Relationships:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html) Information, [structure](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html#structuredef), and [relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html#relationshipsdef) conveyed through [presentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html#presentationdef) can be [programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html#programmaticallydetermineddef) or are available in text. (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html) with techniques and examples.

### Forming a correct headings structure

- Code headings with heading mark-up (`<h1> - <h6>`).
- Assign headings the correct heading level:
  - the main page heading is coded with `<h1>`
  - its subheadings are coded with `<h2>`
  - subheadings of any `<h2>` heading are coded with `<h3>`
  - and so on ...
- Text that does not represent a heading should not coded with heading mark-up.
  - Use CSS classes rather than `<h1> - <h6>` elements to style text that don't represent headings for sections of the page.

```html
<h1>Main heading for the page</h1>

<h2>Heading for the first top level section of the page</h2>
<h3>Heading for a sub-section, nested under the first top level section</h3>
<h4>Heading for a sub-sub-section, nested under that sub-section</h4>

<h2>Heading for the second top level section of the page</h2>
<h3>Heading for a sub-section, nested under the second top level section</h3>
```

#### Example: A heading structure for a weather website

```html
<h1>Local Weather</h1>
<h2>Today's Forecast</h2>
<h2>Tomorrow Forecast</h2>
<h3>Tomorrow's Allergy Forecast</h3>
```

##### Failure example

```html
<div class="heading">Local Weather</div>
<div class="subheading">Today's Forecast</div>
<div class="subheading">Tomorrow Forecast</div>
<div class="subheading2">Tomorrow's Allergy Forecast</div>
```

### Forming a data table

- A cell that is a row header should be coded with `<th scope="row">`;
- A cell that is a column header should be coded with `<th scope="col">`;
- Use `<th scope="rowgroup">` and `<th scope="colgroup">` if the same header applies to multiple rows or columns, but you should avoid complex tables like that as they are hard to understand for screen reader users;
- Cells containing data are coded with `<td>`.

- Avoid making complex data tables (for example tables containing several rows and/or columns of headers, irregular and multi-level headers).

  - If you can't avoid making a complex data table, each data cell should be associated with all its headers via the `scope`, `id` and `headers` attributes.

- A title should be provided for all data tables via the `<caption>` element (or `aria-labelledby` with the `id` of a `h1-h6` element directly introducing the table).

#### Example of a basic table structure

```html
<table>
  <caption>
    Short descriptive name for the table
  </caption>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Column Heading 1</th>
      <th scope="col">Column Heading 2</th>
      <th scope="col">Column Heading 3</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Row Heading 1</th>
      <td>Cell value for row 2, column 2</td>
      <td>Cell value for row 2, column 3</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Row Heading 2</th>
      <td>Cell value for row 3, column 2</td>
      <td>Cell value for row 3, column 3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

#### Do not use HTML tables for layout out content

- The use of layout tables (meaning HTML `table`s solely used to position items on the screen) should be avoided. Use CSS to position the content instead.
- When layout tables cannot be avoided, their source code should contain the ARIA `role="presentation"` attribute, and should not include the `<th>` and `<caption>` elements, and the `headers`, `axis`, `scope` and `summary` attributes.

### Forming lists

- Lists should be coded with the most appropriate HTML list element:

  - `<ul>` for unordered lists;
  - `<ol>` for ordered lists;
  - `<dl>` for description lists.

- List mark-up should be used to accurately describe the structure of lists.

  - For example, do not split items of a same list into two separate `<ul>` elements.

- Content that does not represent a list should not be coded with list mark-up.

#### Example of an ordered list

```html
<ol>
  <li>List value 1</li>
  <li>List value 2</li>
</ol>
```

#### Example of a description list

```html
<dl>
  <dt>Title 1</dt>
  <dd>List value 1</dd>
  <dd>List value 2</dd>
  <dt>Title 2</dt>
  <dd>List value 1</dd>
</dl>
```

#### More guidance on forming lists

### Associating form controls with labels, and associating related form controls

- Form fields that have a visible label should be associated with their label in the HTML code (via the `id` and `for` attributes).

```html
<label for="first-name">First Name</label> <input name="first-name" />
```

- Radio buttons and checkboxes are associated with their label via the `id` and `for` attributes, are grouped together with `<fieldset>` and the question preceding each group is coded with `<legend>`.

#### Common mistakes

- Using the `placeholder` attribute to provide an ['Accessible Name'](/playbook/definitions#accessible-name) for a text `input` field. (The `placeholder` attribute is not well supported by some browsers and assistive technologies combinations, and shouldn't be used for labelling text fields).

### Use HTML5 sectioning elements to describe document structure and outline different parts of the page

- Identify the purpose of each section of content on a page using HTML5 sectioning elements. These create 'Landmark regions' that help screen reader users navigate within a page.

| Element     | What it means                                                                                             | Implicit landmark `role`                                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<header>`  | A section of content that is repeated at the top of all/several pages                                     | `role="banner"` if it is a direct child of `<body>`                              |
| `<nav>`     | An area containing navigation links                                                                       | `role="navigation"`                                                              |
| `<search>`  | A component that allows users to search content on the site                                               | `role="search"`                                                                  |
| `<main>`    | The main content of the page (meaning not header, navigation or footer elements or complementary content) | `role="main"`                                                                    |
| `<form>`    | A form                                                                                                    | `role="form"` if it has an [Accessible Name](/playbook/definitions#accessible-name)   |
| `<section>` | A section of content that you want added in the list of Landmark regions                                  | `role="region"` if it has an [Accessible Name](/playbook/definitions#accessible-name) |
| `<aside>`   | Content that complements the content in the `main` area, but would also make sense on its own             | `role="complementary"`                                                           |
| `<footer>`  | Information about the page (such as copyright)                                                            | `role="contentinfo"` if it is a direct child of `<body>`                         |

- Make sure that every text node on the page is a descendant of a HTML sectioning element.

  - Otherwise screen reader users who navigate pages by landmarks would never find it.

- If a same HMTL sectioning element and/or equivalent ARIA landmark `role` is used multiple times on a page, make sure that each instance has a unique [Accessible Name](/playbook/definitions#accessible-name).

#### Example

```html
<header>
  <div id="logo">...</div>

  <nav aria-label="BBC">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="...">News</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">Weather</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">Sport</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">Travel</a></li>
      ...
    </ul>
  </nav>

  <nav aria-label="News">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="...">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">UK</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">World</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">Business</a></li>
      ...
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>

<main>
  <h1>Pisa rankings: Why Estonian pupils shine in global tests</h1>

  ...
</main>

<aside>...</aside>

<footer>
  <p>BBC 2016</p>
  <ul>
    ...
  </ul>
</footer>
```

##### Failure example

```html
<!-- Do not do this -->
<div id="header">
  <div id="logo">...</div>

  <div id="nav" aria-label="BBC">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="...">News</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">Weather</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">Sport</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">Travel</a></li>
      ...
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div id="nav2" aria-label="News">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="...">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">UK</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">World</a></li>
      <li><a href="...">Business</a></li>
      ...
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="content">
  <h1>Pisa rankings: Why Estonian pupils shine in global tests</h1>

  ...
</div>

<div id="related_content">...</div>

<div id="footer">
  <p>BBC 2016</p>
  <ul>
    ...
  </ul>
</div>
```
