## Summary

For videos that are pre-recorded, it is important to provide an equivalent text description or audio description that accurately describes the visual content of the video.

---

## Requirements

- Video content, such as instructional videos, ads, or interviews, must include audio description or have a text alternative that describes the visual content of the video.

### Common Mistakes

- Failing to provide audio description or a text alternative for the video.
- Audio description that does not describe important visual information conveyed in the video.
- Text alternative that does not adequately describe important visual information conveyed in the video.
- Audio description not synchronized to complement the audio content of the video.

### Why

Providing text or audio description ensures that individuals who are blind or visually impaired can access the information conveyed visually in the video. It makes the content more inclusive and provides a comprehensive understanding of the video for all users.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded):**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-audio-desc.html) An [alternative for time-based media](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-audio-desc.html#alt-time-based-mediadef) or [audio description](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-audio-desc.html#audiodescdef) of the [prerecorded](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-audio-desc.html#prerecordeddef) [video](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-audio-desc.html#videodef) content is provided for [synchronized media](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-audio-desc.html#synchronizedmediadef), except when the media is a [media alternative for text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-audio-desc.html#multimedia-alt-textdef) and is clearly labeled as such. (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-audio-desc.html) with techniques and examples.

Note: pre-recorded videos without sound are covered somewhere else in the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines:
