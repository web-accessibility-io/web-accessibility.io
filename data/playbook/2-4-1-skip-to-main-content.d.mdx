# 2.4.1 - Skip to main content

## Summary

**Give keyboard and screen reader users a way to go directly to the page's main content.**

When content (like a header with navigation links) is repeated at the top of several pages, keyboard users should be able to bypass it and move the [keyboard focus](/playbook/definitions#keyboard-focus) directly to the start of the main content area of the page.

---

## Requirements (Web only)

*   A "Skip to content" link is provided, allowing users to move the [keyboard focus](/playbook/definitions#keyboard-focus) directly to the main content area;
*   The "Skip to content" link is located at (or close to) the start of the page;
*   If the "Skip to content" link is hidden at initially, it becomes visible when it receives [keyboard focus](/playbook/definitions#keyboard-focus).
*   The `<main>` element is used to represent the main content area of the page.

### Common mistakes

*   The `<main>` element has been used, but there is no skip link that points to it;
*   A skip link is provided, but it is always visually hidden and only available to screen reader users.

### Why?

This ensures that people who do not use a mouse can quickly and easily reach the primary content of the page.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**2.4.1 Bypass Blocks:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-skip.html) A [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-skip.html#mechanismdef) is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple [Web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-skip.html#webpagedef). (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-skip.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Design

* Provide visual styles and position for when the link received [keyboard focus](/playbook/definitions#keyboard-focus)
* Label the link 'Skip to content' (like the BBC) or 'Skip to main content' (like Google)

### Examples

* [BBC homepage](https://www.bbc.co.uk/)
* [Deque.com](https://www.deque.com/)

## Guidance for Web

* A `a` element with the text "Skip to main content" is placed right at the start (or very near the start) of the page.
* The `a` element has an `href` attribute pointing to the `id` of the page's `main` element.
* If that "Skip to main content" link is hidden by default, it becomes visible on `:focus`.

### Basic example of a "Skip to main content" link

```html
<body>
  <a href="#main">Skip to main content</a>

  <!-- header and navigation go here -->

  <main id="main">
    <h1>Main heading on the page</h1>

    <p>This is the first paragraph of content on the page</p>

    <!-- ... -->
  </main>

  <!-- ... -->
</body>
```
