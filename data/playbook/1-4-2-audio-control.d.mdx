# Audio control

## Summary

**If any audio content plays automatically for more than three seconds, give people a way to stop it.**

When audio plays automatically on a page, it should last for less than three seconds or there must be a easy way to pause/stop it.

---

## Requirements

* Audio content does not start playing automatically, or stops after 3 seconds or less;
* Audio that plays automatically and lasts for more than three seconds, can be easily paused and/or stopped.

### Why?

* This ensures that people who listen to content with a screen reader can do so without it being drowned out by the audio.
* Unexpected audio may also distress users with cognitive or sensory sensitivity.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.4.2 Audio Control:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-dis-audio.html) If any audio on a Web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level. (Level A)

This [applies to native apps](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/#visual-audio-contrast-dis-audio) by replacing "on a Web page" with "in an app".

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-dis-audio.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Design

### Ideally

* Avoid audio or video content that plays automatically

### If you need to play audio or video content automatically

* Make sure that it lasts less than 3 seconds

### If you can't do any of the above

* Provide a keyboard accessible and clearly-labelled 'Pause' button (e.g. 'Pause video') at the very beginning of the page/screen.

### More guidance for Design

* [Providing a control near the beginning of the Web page that turns off sounds that play automatically](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G170.html) technique in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
