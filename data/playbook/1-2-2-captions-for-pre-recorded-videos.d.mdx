# Captions for pre-recorded videos

## Summary

**Provide captions for videos that are pre-recorded.**

Pre-recorded video content (like instructional videos, ads or interviews) must have captions that are synchronised with the audio content of the video.

---

## Requirements

- All pre-recorded video content has captions that are synchronised with the audio content of the video;
- Captions include all the spoken dialogue and important sound effects from the audio part of the video.

### Common mistakes

- The video does not have synchronised captions;
- The video has captions but they do not include all the spoken dialogue and important sound effects from the audio content of the video;
- The video has captions but they are not synchronised with the audio content of the video.

### Why?

This ensures that the information communicated by the audio part of the video is available to people who can't hear it.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded):**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-captions.html) [Captions](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-captions.html#captionsdef) are provided for all [prerecorded](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-captions.html#prerecordeddef) [audio](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-captions.html#audiodef) content in [synchronized media](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-captions.html#synchronizedmediadef), except when the media is a [media alternative for text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-captions.html#multimedia-alt-textdef) and is clearly labeled as such. (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-captions.html) with techniques and examples.
