# Captions for Pre-recorded Videos

## Summary

**Ensure accessibility by providing captions for pre-recorded videos.**

Pre-recorded video content, such as instructional videos, ads, or interviews, must include captions that are synchronized with the audio content of the video. Captions should accurately represent all spoken dialogue and important sound effects.
---

## Requirements

- All pre-recorded video content must have captions that are synchronized with the audio content of the video.
- Captions should include all the spoken dialogue and important sound effects from the audio part of the video.

### Common Mistakes

- Failing to provide synchronized captions for the video.
- Including captions that do not cover all the spoken dialogue and important sound effects.
- Having captions that are not properly synchronized with the audio content.

### Why

Providing captions ensures that individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing can access the information conveyed in the video. Captions also benefit users in noisy environments or those who prefer to watch videos without sound.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded):**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-captions.html) [Captions](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-captions.html#captionsdef) are provided for all [prerecorded](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-captions.html#prerecordeddef) [audio](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-captions.html#audiodef) content in [synchronized media](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-captions.html#synchronizedmediadef), except when the media is a [media alternative for text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-captions.html#multimedia-alt-textdef) and is clearly labeled as such. (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-captions.html) with techniques and examples.
