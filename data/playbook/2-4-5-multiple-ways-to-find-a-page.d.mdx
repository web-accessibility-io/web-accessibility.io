# Multiple ways to find a page

## Summary

**Give people different ways of finding each page (like searching or browsing links), unless the page is a step in a process.**

There must be different ways for people to locate and navigate to each page â€“ unless the page is a step in a process (like a checkout process for example).

---

## Requirements

* Ensure that each page can be found and navigated to in more than one ways.
  * In addition to navigation menus, the website/app should contain a 'Search' functionality and/or a site map (for large websites), and/or an A-Z index of pages (for small websites).

### Why?

Different people will have different preferences for how to navigate a website/app and find the content they're looking for. For example:
* someone with a cognitive disability may prefer to browse categories to locate content;
* someone using magnification may prefer to use search instead of scrolling through a lengthy navigation block.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**2.4.5 Multiple Ways:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-mult-loc.html) More than one way is available to locate a [Web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-mult-loc.html#webpagedef) within a [set of Web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-mult-loc.html#set-of-web-pagesdef) except where the Web Page is the result of, or a step in, a [process](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-mult-loc.html#processdef). (Level AA)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-mult-loc.html) with techniques and examples.
