## Summary

If a user interface component exists on multiple pages, make sure that the way it looks and the way it is named is consistent across pages.

---

## Requirements

* When the same user interface components, with the same functionality, are used in multiple places, they must be identified in a consistent way. For example:
  * An icon has the same alternative text wherever it is used;
  * Buttons for “Next”, “Previous”, and “Continue”, are labelled consistently wherever they are used;
  * Form fields with the same purpose are consistently labelled wherever they are used.
  * Navigational items that are repeated on multiple pages (e.g. Search field, social media links, related links panels) are labelled consistently across the website/app.

### Common mistakes

* An icon is used to denote a file download, but has a different alternate text whenever it is used;
* A search facility is provided on every page, but the text field and button have different labels on each page.

### Why?

* This helps screen reader users correctly identify the type and purpose of the features that are present on multiple pages/screens.
* It also helps speech-input users know what to say to activate functionalities, based on what worked on other pages/screens.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**3.2.4 Consistent Identification:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-consistent-functionality.html) Components that have the [same functionality](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-consistent-functionality.html#samefunctionalitydef) within a set of [Web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-consistent-functionality.html#webpagedef) are identified consistently. (Level AA)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-consistent-functionality.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Design

### Visible labels

* If you repeat a button with the same functionality across pages, makes sure that the button's label is always the same.

### Accessibility Name

* On your designs, specify what the '[Accessible Name](/playbook/definitions#accessible-name)' of each interactive component should be. This ensures that developers identify user interface components consistently to screen reader and speech-input users.
