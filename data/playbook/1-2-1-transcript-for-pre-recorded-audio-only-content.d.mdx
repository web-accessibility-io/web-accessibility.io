# Transcript for pre-recorded audio-only content

## Summary

**For audio content that has no video (like a podcast), provide a transcript.**

Audio-only content that communicates information (like a podcast) should have a text transcript.

---

## Requirements

- A text transcript is available (on the same page or on a page linked from the page containing the media) for any audio-only content (e.g. podcasts).

### Common mistakes

- Audio-only content that communicates information does not have a text transcript;
- The text transcript for audio-only content does not include all spoken dialogue and sound effects;
- The text transcript for audio-only content is not clearly labelled as such.

### Why?

This ensures that the information is available to people who cannot hear.
