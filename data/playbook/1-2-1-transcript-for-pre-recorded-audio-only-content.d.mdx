# Transcript for Pre-recorded Audio-only Content

## Summary

**Provide a transcript for audio content that has no video (e.g., podcasts) to ensure accessibility.**

Audio-only content, such as podcasts, should include a text transcript.

---

## Requirements

- A text transcript should be available for any audio-only content, either on the same page or on a linked page.

### Common Mistakes

- Audio-only content that conveys information lacks a text transcript.
- The text transcript for audio-only content fails to include all spoken dialogue and sound effects.
- The text transcript for audio-only content lacks clear labeling.

### Why?

Providing a transcript ensures that the information is accessible to individuals who cannot hear.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> - **Prerecorded Audio-only**: An [alternative for time-based media](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-av-only-alt.html#alt-time-based-mediadef) is provided that presents equivalent information for prerecorded audio-only content.
> - **Prerecorded Video-only**: Either an alternative for time-based media or an audio track is provided that presents equivalent information for prerecorded video-only content.

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html) with techniques and examples.
