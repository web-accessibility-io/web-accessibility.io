# Text contrast

## Summary

**Make sure that text has enough contrast against the background colour.**

Text must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 (or 3:1 in some cases) against its background colour.

---

## Requirements

* 'Large scale' text has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against its background.
* Text that is not 'large scale' has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background.

['Large scale' text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html#larger-scaledef) is defined as text that is larger than 18pt/24px, or 14pt/18.5px and bold.

### Why?

* Good colour contrast assists people with vision impairment (including colour blindness) and cognitive impairments when viewing content.
* It also benefits all users in a brightly lit environment.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum):**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html) The visual presentation of [text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html#textdef) and [images of text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html#images-of-textdef) has a [contrast ratio](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html#contrast-ratiodef) of at least 4.5:1, except for the following: (Level AA)

> * **Large Text**: [Large-scale text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html#larger-scaledef) and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1;
> * **Incidental**: Text or images of text that are part of an inactive [user interface component](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html#user-interface-componentdef), that are [pure decoration](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html#puredecdef), that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement.
> * **Logotypes**: Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no minimum contrast requirement.

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Design

User tools like Sketch's Stark plug-in, [Colour Contrast Analyser](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/) to make sure that text has sufficient contrast.
