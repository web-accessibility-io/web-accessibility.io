## Requirements

* Content does not flash more than three times a second.

### Why?

* Visual flicker, flashing and strobe lighting can affect anyone, but some users will be more susceptible than others.
* Symptoms may include eyestrain, dizziness, fatigue, headaches, migraine, and nausea.
* Users with medical conditions such as Ménière's or photosensitive epilepsy can be severely affected, experiencing vertigo, hearing loss and seizures.

A well-documented example of the effects of flicker is [Pokémon Shock – this article is safe to view](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/40269.stm).
