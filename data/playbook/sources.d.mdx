# Main Sources

The base structure and content of the guidelines where based on this project [theappbusiness/accessibility-guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), provided by [Kin + Carta Create](https://www.kinandcarta.com/). Although that project is no longer active, we have taken on the task of continuing its good work and building upon it with a focus on web accessibility. We encourage everyone to contribute to making the internet more inclusive for all users!
