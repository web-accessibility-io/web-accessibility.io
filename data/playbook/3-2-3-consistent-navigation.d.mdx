# 3.2.3 - Consistent navigation

## Summary

**Make sure that navigation controls that appear on multiple pages (like links in a header) are consistent across pages.**

When ways to navigate content (like links) are repeated on multiple pages/screens, the order in which they appear on each page/screen should be consistent.

---

## Requirements

* Navigational items that are repeated on multiple pages of a website (e.g. Search field, social media links, related links panels) are positioned in a consistent order across the website/app.

### Why?

This makes it easier for people to learn how to navigate the website/app, and it enables people to develop strategies (like using screen reader shortcuts)for more efficient navigation.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
