# Consistent navigation

## Summary

**Make sure that navigation controls that appear on multiple pages (like links in a header) are consistent across pages.**

When ways to navigate content (like links for the Web or buttons for native apps) are repeated on multiple pages/screens, the order in which they appear on each page/screen should be consistent.

## Requirements

* Navigational items that are repeated on multiple pages of a website (e.g. Search field, social media links, related links panels) are positioned in a consistent order across the website/app.

### Why?

This makes it easier for people to learn how to navigate the website/app, and it enables people to develop strategies (like using screen reader shortcuts)for more efficient navigation.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**3.2.3 Consistent Navigation:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-consistent-locations.html) Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple [Web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-consistent-locations.html#webpagedef) within a [set of Web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-consistent-locations.html#set-of-web-pagesdef) occur in the [same relative order](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-consistent-locations.html#samerelorderdef) each time they are repeated, unless a change is initiated by the user. (Level AA)

This [applies to native apps](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/#consistent-behavior-consistent-locations) by replacing "Web pages" with "screens".

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-consistent-locations.html) with techniques and examples.
