# Language of Page

## Summary

**Identify the language of the content on a web page in the code to enhance accessibility.**

---

## Requirements

* The default language for the content of a page or app must be defined in the code.

### Why?

This ensures that screen readers automatically use the correct speech libraries for accurate accent and pronunciation.

Correct pronunciation plays a crucial role in facilitating understanding, especially for users of assistive technologies like screen readers. Different languages may require different speech synthesizers. For instance, the word "chat" has a distinct meaning when pronounced using English pronunciation compared to French pronunciation.

#### Other Benefits for the Web

Correctly setting the `lang` attribute in HTML provides additional benefits:
* Quotation marks surrounding the content of `<q>` elements vary based on the language.
* The [`spellcheck` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/spellcheck) relies on language identification to function effectively, especially for multilingual users, as browser heuristics may not be perfect.
* Input components for dates and times also require language identification since time and date formats differ across countries.

### Official Wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**3.1.1 Language of Page:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-doc-lang-id.html) The default [human language](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-doc-lang-id.html#human-langdef) of each [Web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-doc-lang-id.html#webpagedef) can be [programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-doc-lang-id.html#programmaticallydetermineddef). (Level A)

For a detailed explanation of this guideline, refer to the [W3C's documentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-doc-lang-id.html), which includes techniques and examples.

## Guidance for the Web

*   The language of the page should be identified using the `lang` attribute of the `html` element.
    *   For example, the `<html>` element of a page with English content should include `lang="en"`.

Note: It's recommended to use the two-letter language code (e.g., `lang="en"`) rather than including the country code (e.g., `lang="en-gb"` or `lang="en-us"`):
*   Using `lang="en-gb"` would result in screen readers pronouncing the content with a British accent, regardless of the users' preferences, which is not ideal.
*   Using just `lang="en"` allows the content to be pronounced with the accent that matches the users' preferences.

### Example

```html
<html lang="en">
<!--  -->
</html>
```

### Failure example

```html
<html>
<!--  -->
</html>
```

### Common mistakes

*   No `lang` attribute is present on the `html` element.
*   The `lang` attribute is present on the `html` element, but it incorrectly identifies the language of the page.
