# Language of page

## Summary

**In code, identify the language that the content of the page is written in (English for example).**

---

## Requirements

* The default language for the content of a page or app must be defined in the code.

### Why?

This makes sure that screen readers automatically use the correct speech libraries for accent and pronunciation.

When listening, correct pronunciation helps understanding. For users of assistive technologies such as screen readers it is particularly important, as some have different speech synthesizers for different languages. For example, "chat" means something different when using English pronunciation rather than French.

#### Other benefits for the Web

In HTML, correctly setting the `lang` attribute also has other benefits:
* The quotation marks that appear around the content of `<q>` elements are different for different languages;
* The [`spellcheck` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/spellcheck) needs it to function properly, especially for multilingual users, as browser heuristics arenâ€™t perfect;
* Input components for dates and times also need it, because times and dates are written differently around the world.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**3.1.1 Language of Page:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-doc-lang-id.html) The default [human language](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-doc-lang-id.html#human-langdef) of each [Web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-doc-lang-id.html#webpagedef) can be [programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-doc-lang-id.html#programmaticallydetermineddef). (Level A)

This [applies to native apps](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict/#meaning-doc-lang-id) by replacing "Web page" with "app".

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-doc-lang-id.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Web

*   The language of the page is identified using the `lang` attribute of the `html` element.
    *   The `<html>` element of every page with English content includes `lang="en"`.

Note: It's better to only use the two-letter code representing the language (like `lang="en"`), rather than including the country as well (like `lang="en-gb"` or `lang="en-us"`):
*   If you use `lang="en-gb"`, the content will be pronounced by screen readers with a British accent, regardless of the users' preferences. That's not ideal.
*   If you use just `lang="en"`, the content will be pronounced with the accent that matches the users' preferences.

### Example

```html
<html lang="en">
<!--  -->
</html>
```

### Failure example

```html
<html>
<!--  -->
</html>
```

### Common mistakes

*   No `lang` attribute is present on the `html` element.
*   The `lang` attribute is present on the `html` element, but it incorrectly identifies the language of the page.
