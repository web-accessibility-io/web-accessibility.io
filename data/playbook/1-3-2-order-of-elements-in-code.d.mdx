# Order of elements in code

## Summary

**Make sure that elements appear in a logical reading order in code, so that they are presented in a meaningful order to screen reader users.**

Content on the page needs to be announced by screen readers following a logical reading order.

---

## Requirements

* When users navigate the page using a keyboard's 'tab' key, or cursor arrows (when a screen reader is on), elements receive the [keyboard focus](/playbook/definitions#keyboard-focus) and [screen reader cursor]() following a predictable, natural reading order.
  * A natural reading order is from left to right and top to bottom in most cases in Western countries.
  * The easiest way to avoid focus order issues is to make sure that elements are displayed on screen in the same order as they appear in the Document Object Model (Web) / View Hierarchy (iOS and Android).
* Tabular data is presented using proper HTML markup (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements)

### Why?

#### The order in which elements appear in code matters

* Screen readers go through elements on a page/screen in the order in which they appear in the Document Object Model (Web) / View Hierarchy (iOS and Android), which is a tree-like structure that contains all the elements on the page.

* The order in which elements appear in that Document Object Model / View Hierarchy might be different from the order in which they're laid out visually on screen.
    * This can happen for example if certain CSS techniques are used to change the relative positioning of elements on the page.

* The order in which elements appear in that Document Object Model / View Hierarchy matters to user experience.
    * When people use a screen reader, the keyboard or a Switch control, they interact with elements on the page in the order in which they appear in that Document Object Model / View Hierarchy.

* So make sure that elements appear in the Document Object Model / View Hierarchy in a reading order that's natural and makes sense.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-sequence.html) When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a [correct reading sequence](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-sequence.html#correct-reading-sequencedef) can be [programmatically determined](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-sequence.html#programmaticallydetermineddef). (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-sequence.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Design

* When you provide different designs for different screen sizes (e.g. desktop and mobile, or for different break points), make sure that elements appear in the same order across on the different designs.
  * If you can't do that, call it out to developers as they're likely to need to create different structures for the different designs.

### Common mistakes

* The order of interactive elements is not consistent across designs for different screen sizes.
  * For example, imagine that you've designed a modal dialog with two buttons: 'Cancel' and 'OK':
    * On the design for large screens, the 'Cancel' button is positioned to the left of the 'OK' button. ('Cancel' comes before 'OK' in the reading order).
    * But on the design for small screens, the 'Cancel' button is positioned to the bottom of the 'OK' button. ('Cancel' now comes after 'OK' in the reading order).

## Guidance for Web

* Screen reader software renders content in the order in which it appears in the Document Object Model (DOM). Place content in the DOM in a correct reading order either through source code or inserting nodes via JavaScript.

### Do not use positive values with `tabindex`

* Do not use positive values with `tabindex`.

#### Example

```html
<h1 tabindex="-1">I'm the heading for a modal dialog</h1>
...
<div tab-index="0" class="fake_button" aria-role="button">Button Label</div>
```

#### Failure example

```html
<div tab-index="3" class="fake_button" aria-role="button">Button Label</div>
```

### Be careful when using CSS Float, Flexbox, Grid and `position`

* With CSS Flexbox, don't use the `order` property or `flex-direction: reverse;`;
* With CSS Grid, be careful with manual placement of items on the grid;
* When using `position` `absolute`, `fixed` or `sticky`, be careful to not detach the visual order of elements from the order in which they appear in the DOM;

#### Example

```html
<main>
 <div style="float:left;">
  <h1>Article header</h1>
  <div>Article content</div>
 </div>

 <aside style="float:right;">Supplementary info</aside>
</main>
```

#### Failure example

```html
<main>
  <h1>Article header</h1>
  <aside style="position:relative; left:50%;top:-50%;">Supplementary info</aside>
  <div>Article content</div>
</main>
```

### Make new content appear in the DOM right after the element that triggers it

* If a button triggers extra content to appear (like a menu), make sure that that extra content appears next to the button in both the DOM order and visual order.

### How to test whether elements appear in a logical reading order in the DOM

* Turn off CSS on the page to see elements laid out on screen in the order in which they appear in the Document Object Model.

### Common mistakes

* The DOM order does not match the visual order because CSS properties like flexbox and grid-layout have been used to alter the visual presentation;
* The DOM order does not match the visual order because `tabindex` has been used with a value other than `-1` or `0`.
* A 'Agree to cookies' dialog that's positioned last in the DOM but appears at the top of the screen, without being implemented as modal (with the `inert` attribute)
* When CSS styles are disabled, the focus order is meaningless;
* Using dialogs or menus that are not adjacent to their trigger control in the sequential navigation order.
* Tabular data is displayed using CSS to present the appearance of a table, but the proper HTML markup has not been used;
