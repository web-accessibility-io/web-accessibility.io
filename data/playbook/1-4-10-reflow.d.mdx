# Reflow

## Summary

**Make sure users can access all information and functionality on a screen that's as wide as on the iPhone5, without needing to scroll in both directions.**

On smaller devices or when content is zoomed there should be no loss of information or functionality, and users should not be required to scroll content both vertically and horizontally.

---

## Requirements

* Make sure that all content and functionality are available on 320pt-wide screens.
* Make sure your pages are responsive and the content will ‘reflow’ to a single column gracefully.
* A simple browser based test is to view the page with a viewport width of 320px, or 1280px at 400% zoom.
  * You can zoom in on a Mac in Chrome by pressing Command and + key, until you see the resolution hit 400%.

#### Common mistakes

* Content does not reflow to a single column when zoomed.
* Horizontal scrolling appears in both directions at some low resolutions when content is zoomed.
* Using fixed sized containers and fixed position content.

### Why?

* People who are sight impaired often use screen magnification to resize page content and this can cause info to get lost.
* Scrolling can often be difficult for some disabled users, more so when horizontally or both horizontally and vertically at the same time.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**1.4.10 Reflow (Level AA):**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for:
>
> * Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 [CSS pixels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html#dfn-css-pixel);
> * Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 [CSS pixels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html#dfn-css-pixel).
>
> Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.
>
> Note: 320 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport width of 1280 CSS pixels wide at 400% zoom. For web content which is designed to scroll horizontally (e.g., with vertical text), 256 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport height of 1024 CSS pixels at 400% zoom.
>
> Examples of content which requires two-dimensional layout are images, maps, diagrams, video, games, presentations, data tables, and interfaces where it is necessary to keep toolbars in view while manipulating content.

### Displaying code

The use of &lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt; formatted content (such as code) can cause horizontal scrolling. Using the CSS declarations such as word-wrap: break-word; on &lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt; in small viewports will help to avoid horizontal scrolling at all.
