# Changes on focus

## Summary

**Just navigating to an interactive control with the keyboard shouldn't trigger any action, and shouldn't move the keyboard focus somewhere else.**

---

## Requirements

When a user interface element receives [keyboard focus](/playbook/definitions#keyboard-focus) (for example when users reach it by pressing the 'Tab' key, or when they click on it), that should not cause any big change to happen, such as:
* automatically loading a new page;
* submitting a form;
* moving the keyboard focus somewhere else;
* significantly changing the content of the page.

Such changes only occur when initiated by the user (e.g. upon activation of a button or link).

### Common mistakes

*   A dropdown menus automatically triggers navigation as the user uses the 'Tab' or 'Arrow' keys to move between the options.
*   A big change (like loading a new page) happens when a user is merely leaving a form control.
*   [Focusing](/playbook/definitions#keyboard-focus) an element automatically moves the [keyboard focus](/playbook/definitions#keyboard-focus) to another element.

### Why?

This stops unexpected things happening without screen reader and screen magnifer users being aware of it.

### Official wording in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

> [**3.2.1 On Focus:**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-receive-focus.html) When any component receives focus, it does not initiate a [change of context](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-receive-focus.html#context-changedef). (Level A)

See the [W3C's detailed explanation of this guideline](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-receive-focus.html) with techniques and examples.

## Guidance for Design

* Make sure you don't design an interaction, where moving the [keyboard focus](/playbook/definitions#keyboard-focus) to an element causes any of the following to happen:
- navigating to a new page, or reloading the page
- submitting a form
- moving the keyboard focus somewhere else
- [significantly changing](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-receive-focus.html#context-changedef) the content on a page

---

## Guidance for Web

*   `focus` or `blur` events do not cause dis-orientating events such as:
- navigating to a new page
- reloading the page
- submitting a form
- moving the focus somewhere else using the `HTMLElement.focus()` method
- [significantly changing](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-receive-focus.html#context-changedef) the content on a page
